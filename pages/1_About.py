Hi, Iâ€™m Ikechukwu Chilaka, a data engineer and technology strategist with more than seven years of professional experience in customer experience, data analytics, and data engineering.
<br><br>My career has been centered around solving real-world business problems through scalable data systems, automation, and analytics that inform impactful decisions. Over the years, I have worked with prominent financial institutions such as United Bank for Africa (UBA) and Carbon Microfinance Bank, where I led and contributed to key projects that improved operational efficiency, enhanced customer outcomes, and drove data-informed strategies across teams.<br><br>

In addition to my roles in the corporate sector, I am the Chief Data Strategist and Co-founder of contactOZ, a startup dedicated to enabling organizations across Nigeria to build truly customer-centric workforces.
I also hold membership with the British Computer Society (BCS), the Chartered Institute for IT, where I continue to engage in global conversations around professionalism, ethics, and emerging best practices in data and technology.

At the core of everything I do is a desire to bridge the gap between technology and people. Whether Iâ€™m building automated systems, designing scalable data workflows, or mentoring others in tech, Iâ€™m driven by the belief that people should always come first.
